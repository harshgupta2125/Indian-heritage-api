# Indian-heritage-api
This project is a public API built with FastAPI that provides a dummy dataset of structured access to India's rich and diverse cultural heritage. It includes endpoints for historical sites, cultural events,  and local traditions â€” making it useful for tourism apps, cultural education platforms, museum guides, and academic research.
